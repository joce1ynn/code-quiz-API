# Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Purpose
I created this coding quiz app by using JS, HTML and CSS. JavaScript can be frustrating sometimes. I had issues in storing local data, and retrieving data from local storage as well. However, when I solved these problems via Google searchï¼Œ watching Youtube tutorials or figuring out by myself, I felt happy and fulfilling. Happy coding! 

## Build With
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
